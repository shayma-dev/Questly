/* 
  Component-specific (but still global) styles for App.jsx/ App.js
  - import this file in App.jsx

  • Its rules are also global (they go into the same big <style> bundle) but by convention they are intended to style the App component and any direct children that rely on those class names.

  Typical content:
  – Layout for the main app wrapper (.App { text-align: center; })
  – Styles for elements that live “close” to App (e.g., a header logo animation provided by the template)
  – Nothing that unrelated components should depend on
